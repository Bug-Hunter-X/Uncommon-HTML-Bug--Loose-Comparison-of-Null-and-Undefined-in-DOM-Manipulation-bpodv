# Uncommon HTML Bug: Loose Comparison of Null and Undefined

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null and undefined checks in older browsers when working with the Document Object Model (DOM). The bug arises from improper comparisons when checking if a DOM element exists before manipulating it.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains HTML code with a div element.  A JavaScript function attempts to hide this div element. However, the comparison `== null || == undefined` is used to test for the absence of the element.  In older browsers, this loose comparison can fail unexpectedly leading to errors.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the corrected approach using strict equality (`===`) to check for null and undefined. This approach is more reliable across different browsers and JavaScript versions.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a browser.
2. Observe the behavior and the console for errors.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the correct implementation.

## Conclusion

This bug highlights the importance of using strict equality when checking for null and undefined to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure cross-browser compatibility when dealing with DOM manipulation.
